# Exploring LLMs (Llama3.2-1B) Ability to Process Sensor Time Series Data

# Abstract

LLMs, as language models, are known for their ability to generalize across various natural language tasks. Existing works have leveraged their world knowledge and pattern-matching abilities to perform time series forecasting by incorporating adapters for numerical input and projection heads for output. However, there has been little exploration into whether LLMs, with the addition of adapters or proper fine-tuning, can perform general time series tasks—such as imputation, classification, and outlier detection—without task-specific fine-tuning.
